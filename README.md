A little RPG-lite for CS finals

## What is this?
This is a little RPG I made for a CS final project. Everything (including documentation) was made during a week (to be fair, it was more like 3 days). 
Documentation (which was extremely rushed) is incomplete and will remain as such. It can be found in the main project folder.

*This repository will remain as-is and serves as merely a proof of work.*
